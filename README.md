### Intention

​		Recently I become a fan of Dreamcatcher which is a Kpop group. The live show or video are almost in korean which means I have to wait for subtitle group to do the translation. Foreigin TV series has the same issue as well, so I decide to  make a program to do all this.

​		YouTube and Google has made great job on this, but it's need to upload file. I want to make it more flexible and lightweight.
